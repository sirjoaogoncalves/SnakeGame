			<li>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard if you are playing on desktop.</li>
			<li>If you are playing on a touch-based device, such as a smartphone or a tablet, use your finger to swipe in the direction you want the snake to move.</li>
			<li>Make sure not to hit the walls or your own tail. If the snake hits a wall or its own tail, the game will be over.</li>
			<li>
				The goal of the game is to eat as many fruits as possible. Each time the snake eats a fruit, it will grow longer. Try to see how long you can make the snake before it hits a wall or its own
				tail.

			<li>Have fun and try to beat your high score!</li>
